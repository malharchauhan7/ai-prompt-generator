            Hereâ€™s what you should do:
            1. Identify the user's intent or goal behind the vague prompt.
            2. Add necessary context, tone, format, and output instructions.
            3. Clarify any ambiguity, and make assumptions only when reasonable.
            4. Structure the final output in a way that's clear for an AI to follow.

            make sure to remember that give direct prompt don't write anything like "Okay,I understand..." or "Enhanced Prompt" just give direct Enhanced Prompt
